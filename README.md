# Welcome

Welcome to the Documentation site for The Zander Project. Majority of the version updates I will be updating the documentation site for things like web function updates, Discord command updates configuration updates and also in game features that I've coded and developed.

If you see something that is missing from the documentation site or would like to add something to documentation site or to expand on aspect of the documentation site please go to the GitHub repository and open a pull request and I will review it and get back to you.
